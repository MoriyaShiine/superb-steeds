  <h3>Superb Steeds aims to reduce the tedium and increase the usefulness of horses!</h3>
</div>

The features this mod offers are:
```
* Horses no longer have determined statistics upon breeding, but instead every horse has a strength value from 1-5 in speed and jump. This is shown in an extended section of the horse inventory GUI.
* These stats can be trained by simply riding the horse with a saddle, and will increase over time.
* Horses no longer require a saddle to be controlled. This will however not count towards training.
* Saddles will prevent a horse from bucking.
* You can now feed horses while riding them by interacting with it with a food item (excluding hay bales) while looking down.
* All horses have 15 hearts instead of a variable amount.
* Leather horse armor allows horses to safely ride over powder snow.
* Skeleton Horses are no longer slowed by Soul Sand.
* Llamas can be trained to have more inventory slots by leading them around.
```
